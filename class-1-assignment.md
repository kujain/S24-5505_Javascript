## Make a decision tree of an often repeated Physical Activity of your choice

Choose a regular physical activity  (or online but non-digital)  that you perform on a regular basis or select a task that requires some interaction and decision-making. Write the process flow out in detail. You can create a visual flow like the illustration attached or the example in the class 1 presentation, or use some other form of presentation (format can be anything you prefer - from a webpage, digital graph to a hand sketch).

**Rubric**: Decision trees  are a core part of any decision making process, whether you elaborate it as in this exercise or not. It helps you get a deeper understanding of how your program (activity) can be designed/coded and to eventually figure out the structure and approach that you will eventually take. More complex  programs get great clarity when outlined this way early in the process and doing this before starting to code provides an excellent understanding of the scope. complexity and structure of a project and find potential gotchas.

Please do this by hand (no figma, photoshop, illustrator etc.) and scan/snap and submit the document (pdf/jpg/doc/url) to this assignment on canvas (or email) before the next class so I can review/comment and share.
