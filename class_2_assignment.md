## The following small projects will help you review and test the concepts we covered during the last class.


### 1. Conditions:
See below some code to find the current time and hour using the Date() function.

Create a condition to check if it's the morning, evening, afternoon or night. Use console.log to output an appropriate message. 

```
let current_time = Date();
let current_hr = current_time.getHours();
``` 

### 2. Loops:
Use the same random dice generator as used in class to generate a number between 1 and 6. Now create a loop that keep rolling until the number generated is more than 3. As soon as you get a number more than three, the loop should end. Output how many times the loop ran before it reached this number. Be careful with this - if you create a loop that has no way to end (due to a faulty check), it will easily crash your browser!

 

### 3. Loops
Using loops , create a triangular pattern (using console.log statements only for now) like this:
```
#
##
###
####
```
 

### 4. Loops and Conditions:

Using more loops and conditions, create a chess board using # and space ' ' using console.log statements.  You could consider using a loop inside a loop to create the alternative pattern. A chess board  has  8 x 8 = 64 squares.
